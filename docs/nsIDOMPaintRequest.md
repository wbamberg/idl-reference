# nsIDOMPaintRequest #
  
These objects are exposed by the MozDOMAfterPaint event. Each one represents  
a request to repaint a rectangle that was generated by the browser.  
  

## Attributes ##

### clientRect ###
  
The client rect where invalidation was triggered.  
  

### reason ###
  
The reason for the request, as a string. If an empty string, then we don't know  
the reason (this is common). Reasons include "scroll repaint", meaning that we  
needed to repaint the rectangle due to scrolling, and "scroll copy", meaning  
that we updated the rectangle due to scrolling but instead of painting  
manually, we were able to do a copy from another area of the screen.
